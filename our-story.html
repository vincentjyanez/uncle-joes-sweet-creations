        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Uncle Joe‚Äôs Sweet Creations began with Joseph Soprano Sr., who started the family bakery in Brooklyn. With a passion for baking and a commitment to quality, Joseph Sr. built a strong foundation for the business. Today, his legacy continues with his son, Joey Soprano Jr., and his grandson, Joe Soprano, who carry on the tradition of crafting delicious cakes, pastries, and custom treats. We take pride in offering a welcoming space for our community to enjoy sweet creations made with love, just as we always have.</p>
